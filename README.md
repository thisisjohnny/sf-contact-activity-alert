# Salesforce Contact Activity Alert
You're sitting down with your first cup of coffee in the morning and about to start hitting the phone lines and make those sales calls. You're bumping up against an issue and need to reach out to another group for help. You have to call up a vendor to for help with a warranty repair issue.

There are any number of reasons why Contacts in Salesforce can be extremely helpful. But what's not helpful is calling someone up or sending an email to an individual who doesn't work with that organization any more. This [LWC](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/component-library/documentation/lwc) provides an easy to see alert on your screen for contacts you haven't reached out to in a while. Just a simple little word of caution to ensure you're speaking with the right people.
